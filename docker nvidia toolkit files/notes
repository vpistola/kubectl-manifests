1. CREATE THE BASE IMAGE OF THE CONTAINER
  - Add to Dockerfile any required packages
  - Build the image and name it ubuntu-ssh using: docker build . -t ubuntu-ssh

2. EDIT THE DOCKER COMPOSE FILE
  - Change in the docker-compose.yaml file the following:
    - volumes: (you must specify the volume, like vol1, to have a persistence in a folder on the host)
      - /home/chairiq/docker_volumes/vol1:/opt/volume
    - ports:  (change the 2222 to give each one container a unique ssh port)
      - '2222:22'
    - change the field 'device_ids'
    - adjust the limits
  - Create a different folder for each newly created container. Each folder must contain a copy of the docker-compose file 
  - docker compose up -d  (to create the container)
